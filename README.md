# UFOs


Overview

Danaâ€™s webpage and dynamic table are working as intended. However, she would like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings. She has the vision to have users filter for multiple criteria. 





Results

The Filter Search is updated to include the five elements:  Date, City, State, Country, and Shape.

The webpage filters the table based on user input.

Summary

Drawbacks

* The filter does not seem to be as intuitive.  The user must know specific dates, cities, or shapes to search.  Additionally, cities must be typed out in a certain way; lower case.  


Recommendatons

*  Having the ability to pull up a month's worth of data vs a specific date.  For example, 1/2010 vs 01/05/2010.
*  Having the ability to accept other characters besides limited to lower case.  For example, El Cajon or El cajon vs el cajon only.
